This application takes in user input for single-product purchases.

Bamazon shows the user a list of products

The user selects a product and tells Bamazon the corresponding product ID

The user tells Bamazon a desired quantity

Bamazon compares the user's desired quantity with the current inventory

The purchase cannot move forward until the user requests a quantity that's less than or equal to what's in stock
Once a fulfillable quantity is requested, Bamazon processes the order and simultaneously reduces that product's quantity in the inventory database
